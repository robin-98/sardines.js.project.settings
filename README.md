# Introduction

Sardines was designed to help small and micro startup teams to eliminate bottlenecks of cloud computing. First implemented in Javascript to facilitate full-stack development of both frontend and backend. Its prototype version named BND came to be used in a few projects in Meituan-Dianping in 2017. Sardines was completely refactored in late of 2019, and was synchronously developed with and applied in the app Dietitian.

# Why Sardines

1. High integration: Sardines encapsulates major cloud computing platforms, transforms your application from the distributed architecture into a stand-alone version, greatly improves the efficiency of R&D and maintenance. 

2. Service sharing: once your application was published, the backend services of your application could be shared with third-party customers without any influence on your application;

3. Service integrating: you could conveniently re-use any third-party services in your application just like integrating a local library when developing a stand-alone program.

4. Lifetime Easy-To-Use: you will benifit all aspects during every period of the lifetime of your application, including the development, deployment, maintenance, scaling, refactoring and integrating with other applications.

5. Save money: computing cost will be charged in function and service level granularity, no more servers or clusters

# Example application

As the first application developed and live on Sardines, the app Dietitian's first version used a hybird frontend architecture, and used the Javascript version of Sardines to build backend services and integrate these services in its frontend Javascript code.
